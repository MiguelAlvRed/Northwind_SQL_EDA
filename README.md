# Northwind_SQL_EDA
EDA based in the Northwind DB using SQL through PostgreSQL


At this JupyterNotebook I'm going to answer different business questions based on the Northwind Database, this DB was create on PostgreSQL so, first of all, I have to connect to my local host and then launch the queries.

To make it possible I used the following libraries:

    * Pandas: To store the created dataframes
    * Pandas.io.sql: To read the SQL queries into dataframes
    * Psycog2: To connect the notebook to the PostgreSQL engine
    Warnings: To make expections on warnings

Business Questions:

    * What is the total number of clients per country?
    * What is the total number of orders per country?
    * What is the average price per order per country?
    * What is the total invoice for each country?
    * What is the total profit for each country?
    * What are the 10 most ordered products?
    * What are the 10 most expensive products?
    * What are the 10 products with the highest invoice?
    * What are the 10 products with the highest unit profit?
    * What are the 10 most profitable products?
